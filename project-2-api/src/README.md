## General approach:

Already had an API to use (horoscope) discussed how we could use it with added feature of a second API
Set up git repo
Built the basic structure together using <p></p> to return hard coded information on pages to check if they worked using live code share
Divided the work and what components we would work on. In class time disscussed what was done and what needed to be done
When a problem occured - shared it - solved it
When we changed or did something significant would share and explain what we did to each other
A new feture we used was storing data onto the local storage so that it could be used on another component by the APIs ( first have to convert the JavaScript object or value to a JSON string then you can store it)
Stored:

- Value of buttons from HoroscopeIndex.js
- User info data from UserInfo.js
- The response from the horoscope API so that it could be used by the news API

## Installation instructions for any dependencies:

All in terminal:
bulma - yarn add bulma
axios - yarn add axios
aztro-js - yarn add aztro-js

## Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome:

- Main struggle was calling the APIs to the page (Note/kim - i noticed that i wasn't reading the documentation properly/had difficulty interpretating it)
- Took a while to figure out how to store data to local storage
- Styling in general was quite tricky with multiple elements (HoroscopeIndex.js)
- News API - because we used the documentation to pull the data over it kept sending out multipe requests and we were unsure on how to rearange it so that it would only make one request

---

## future work

- Horoscope API had links for yesterday and tomorrow readings
- Make code more DRY (HoroscopeDaily.js and HoroscopeCard.js basically using many of the same functions)

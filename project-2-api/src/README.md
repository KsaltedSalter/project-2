Horoscope API
https://aztro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
https://github.com/sameerkumar18/aztro
News API
https://rapidapi.com/contextualwebsearch/api/web-search/details

A couple of paragraphs about the general approach you took:
Already had an API to use (horoscope) discussed how we could use it with added feature of a second API
Set up git repo
Built the basic structure using <p></p> together to return basic information on pages to check if they worked using live code share
Divided the work and what pages we would work on in class time disscussed what was done and what needed to be done
when a problem occured - shared it - solved it
When we changed or did something significant would share and explain what we did to each other

Installation instructions for any dependencies
In terminal
bulma - yarn add bulma
axios - yarn add axios
aztro-js - yarn add axios

Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles your team had to overcome
Main struggle was calling the API to the page (kim - i noticed that i wasn't reading the documentation properly/had difficulty interpretating it)
Took a while to figure out how to store data to local storage
Styling in general was quite tricky with multiple divs
